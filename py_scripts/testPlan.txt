Test Plan

All scripts should pass the following test plan. Please add to it if there's anything new.

1. Empty case: the target caseid(s) is not present in the result table
	a) successfully insert one caseid into the database
	b) successfully insert multiple caseids into the database
	
	Expected behavior:
		- Results of the caseid(s) are inserted into the result table
	
2. Present case: the target caseid(s) is already present in the result table
	a) All the results are present (after successful execution of the script)
	b) Some of the results are present, some are lost (by manually deleting some rows e.g. bins, blocks of this caseid from the result table)
    c) Multiple caseids are passed into the function when some (or all) of the results are in record. 
	
	Expected behavior:
		- Delete all rows of the caseid from result table and insert again
	A more complicated way:
		- Update, when the results are complete
		- Delete and insert, when the results are present but corrupted (some rows lost)

3. Corner cases for interacting with database:
	a) Internet connection is lost, during connection, reading, analyzing, writing back.
	b) Connection key (host address, user, etc.) is entered incorrectly
	
	Expected behavior:
		- Return the error code for the specific problem
		- If possible, avoid incomplete changes to the database

4. Corner cases for data analysis:	// not tested yet
	a) input data exceed normal range: e.g. small than zero, larger than 1
	b) input data contains nan/null
	
	Expected behavior:
		- Return error code 9 for analysis algorithm error
		- If possible, avoid incomplete changes to the database
